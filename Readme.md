# tRPC + Express + React Scaffolding

This is a minimal monorepo for Express.js as backend and React frontend with tRPC support. Which is can be used as a starting point for any express trpc react application, with prisma.

## Clone and install dependencies 🏭

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/trulymittal/t3-app-with-express-react-vite-trpc-prisma.git
$ cd t3-app-with-express-react-vite-trpc-prisma
$ npm i --workspaces
# Only if using the prisma ORM
$ npx prisma db push
```

## Why another tRPC + Express + React boilerplate generator ❓

1. Only installs the bare bones 💀 and "mostly" required dependencies whenever you try to start a new trpc express react application in a monorepo.
2. Example TODO router, i.e. CRUD operations are demonstrated on the frontend React and backend express application, to give you an idea of how trpc works

## Quick Start 🏃‍♂️

The quickest way to get started is to clone the project and install the dependencies using:

```bash
$ npm i --workspaces
$ npm run dev
```
